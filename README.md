# Introduction

Matrices (singluar: Matrix) are rectangular arrays of Numbers (sometimes symbols) arranged in Rows or Columns. For example
[1 2 34
32 5 94]
is a two by three (2x3) array. 

Matrix multiplication is a useful concept in computer science; for example, GPUs are essentially powerful parallel matrix multipliers. 
Multiplication of matrices are however simply a series of arithmetic operations which computers are fairly fast at. 
We will multithread the operation to see what kind of speedups are possible for this type of problem.

# Objectives
This project is to learn basic multithreading through implementing matrix multiplication and demonstrate the potential speedup gains that multithreading offers.
